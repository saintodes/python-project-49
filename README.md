    brew install python

Install Poetry `([https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation))`

After that, using the commands:

    make build
    make publish
    make package-install

Install the package into the system. After that, you can launch the applications by names:

    brain-games
    
    brain-even
    
    brain-calc
    
    brain-gcd
